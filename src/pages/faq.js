              More concretely, Tinkersynth is an art store where you build art
              by poking at sliders and buttons. The goal isn't to provide a
              linear path to a specific piece of art, but rather to encourage
              experimentation. Tinkersynth prioritizes being delighted by
              unexpected effects rather than creating an intuitive, predictable
              tool.

            <Paragraph>
              The machines on Tinkersynth are examples of generative art. Unlike
              most traditional forms of visual art, generative art is produced
              by an algorithm.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              An algorithm is a fancy computer word, but really it just means
              that the art is produced by following a set of discrete,
              repeatable steps. For example, the
              <TextLink to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph">
                Spirograph
              </TextLink>{' '}
              produces generative art by following an algorithm as well. You can
              produce 10 identical pieces by following the same steps, and you
              can produce different pieces by modifying those steps, or changing
              the input parameters (like which gear to use).
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              The Slopes machine uses an algorithm inspired by{' '}
              <TextLink to="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/blogs/assets/sa-visual/Image/SciAm_pulsar.jpg">
                data visualizations of electromagnetic radiation
              </TextLink>
              . In its simplest form, it draws each row 1 at a time, using a
              form of randomization known as perlin noise to come up with the
              slopes.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              The controls on the Slopes machine turn what would otherwise be a
              fairly static piece into something dynamic and unpredictable.
              There are 22 individual controls which each affect the algorithm.
              Some, like the "perspective" slider in the top left, are
              reasonably predictable: it controls the height and distance
              between rows. Others are more inscrutable, like the "split earth"
              control which uses the tangent function to remarkable effect. Each
              control affects how the others behave, and the result is that
              there are over 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible
              outputs.

              While developing the Slopes machine, it was important that the
              performance was top-notch: having a short feedback loop is
              imperative to discovering neat tricks, and coming up with great
              art.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              The performance varies pretty drastically depending on the
              settings chosen, since some settings increase the work that the
              machine has to do. Here are some tricks you can use to speed up
              the machine.

                One of the more computationally-intensive steps is making sure
                that lines are "occluded" by earlier lines. By disabling this,
                you reduce the amount of work needed to be done.

            <Paragraph>
              Even if you want your final piece of artwork to include many
              occluded lines, it can be advantageous to experiment with these
              recommended settings, and then crank them up once you're happy
              with the result.

              At this time, there is no way to save individual works, other than
              by purchasing them.

            <Paragraph>
              When you purchase an item (whether fine-art print or vector/raster
              download), a special link is included with your confirmation
              email. This link restores the machine to the settings used for
              your purchase. This way, you can always pick up where you left
              off.

            <Paragraph>
              Note that we didn't intend for saving to be a "premium" feature;
              we'd love to offer the ability for everyone to create and share
              collections of works. We hope to develop this in a future release,
              but Tinkersynth is a very new product and a lot of quality-of-life
              improvements didn't make it into this MVP.

            <Paragraph>
              Originally, we had hoped to create a first-class mobile
              experience, on par with the desktop experience. During
              development, it became clear that it wasn't really feasible.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The Tinkersynth machines work so well because of the tight
              feedback loop: when you drag a slider or toggle a switch, you can
              immediately see what effect this has on the artwork, since both
              the controls and the art are visible at the same time.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              In our original mobile design, the machine's controls took up the
              entire screen, so you had to make an adjustment, then swipe up to
              see the effect. It felt really labor-intensive, and not a great
              experience.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              We decided to offer a limited subset for mobile, where the primary
              mechanism for generating new art was the grey "Shuffle" button.
              This button randomizes all the other controls, and can produce an
              incredible range of potential outputs. With this solution, we can
              fit the entire thing on your phone's screen, and still offer the
              ability to create interesting, unique works of art.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              That said, the desktop experience offers so much more control.
              It's worth trying on a device with a larger screen, if possible.

              <strong>Yes!</strong> Digital downloads purchased through
              Tinkersynth provide a plotter-friendly SVG. All of the occlusion
              is done mathematically, rather than relying on SVG fills or masks,
              so that you can plot the SVG directly with programs like Inkscape.

              (<TextLink to="https://axidraw.com/">Pen plotters</TextLink> are
              machines that create art by mechanically moving a pen over paper.
              The end result is a charming, clearly-not-printed effect that is
              perfect for displaying the art created with Tinkersynth.)
