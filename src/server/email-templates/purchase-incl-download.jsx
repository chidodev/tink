      Good news - our servers in Toronto have been hard at work assembling your
      art, pixel by pixel, and they've just completed the job.

        <p>
          We've produced two print-ready raster images, and a scalable vector
          image. We hope that these assets will be useful for whatever creative
          endeavors you have in mind.

          We'll email you in a few days to let you know when your physical fine
          art print has shipped.

        This infinitely-scalable .svg can be thought of as a film negative; it
        can be used to produce raster images of any size.

    <h4>Jpeg conversion</h4>

    <p>
      We've chosen the Portable Network Graphics (.png) format for our raster
      images, because they produce less compression artifacts than jpegs. If
      your print shop only accepts .jpg/.jpeg images, though, you can use an{' '}
      <a href="https://png2jpg.com/">online conversion tool</a> to quickly
      convert your .png into a .jpg.
