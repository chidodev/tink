# Plotter settings

General:

- Tweak the pen lower position to 3-4% below what it is when setting the pen

For Muji pens:

- use 0.38mm pens for best results, on smooth paper
- Set pen-down speed to 15%, pen-up speed to 85%
- Constant speed while pen is down
- (todo) set pen lowering speed to "Slow"?
